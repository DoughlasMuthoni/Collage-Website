                        Mwala Technical And Vocational Collage was started as a skills training centre by Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) in 1990.
                        Its initial training programs were short-term skills upgrading courses to Youth Polytechnic instructors and Jua Kali artisans. 
                        The Institute was then called <b>Mwala Technical And Vocational Collage Skills Training Centre</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Between 1990 and 1993 VSO constructed a large building complex housing two training workshops, stores, offices, 
                        and four small rooms which were used as hostels. In 1993 the European Economic Community (E.E.C) funding was discontinued, 
                        leading to the withdrawal of VSO from the centre. It was then handed over to the Kenya government, which seconded it to 
                        the Ministry of Research, Technical Training and Technology (MRTTT).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        MRTTT placed the centre under the youth support program and started preparing it to become a technical training institute 
                        to offer long-term training programs in line with other technical institutes in the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to prepare the centre to offer the new training programs, the government started sending trained and qualified teachers 
                        in 1993. Training of the long-term courses started in 1994 when the first Kenya Accounting Technician Certificate (KATC) intermediate 
                        course was introduced. In 1996, the Motor Vehicle Mechanics artisan course was introduced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Between 1993 and 1996 DANIDA, an NGO working under Micro and Small Infrastructure Program (MSIP), supported the centre to run 
                        the short-term courses and then soon afterward introduced the long-term courses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The process of registering the institute was started in 1997, and on 1/3/1999, the centre was registered as a Technical Training 
                        Institute under the certificate of registration No <b>MRT/PC/301/99</b>, and its name was changed to Mwala Technical And Vocational Collage. 
                        In the year 2002, the institute, through the Kenyan Government, acquired funds for further development and establishment of the 
                        long-term programs.
